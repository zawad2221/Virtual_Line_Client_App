## Objectives

Main objectives of implementing this project are listed below to better understand what are the goals -

* Allowing shop/store owner create a virtual line in front of theirs store to replace the physical line
* Allowing customers check in a line to get access in a store while they aren't in front of the store.
* Helps customers to maintain social distance by replacing the physical line with virtual line
* Helps customers to find nearby store 

## Motivation 
Corona virus has affected the world economy, risking public health and causing death of hundreds of thousands people. Lots of shops, super shops, pharmacies have been closed since the corona epidemic began. Some of them offering service based on some condition. One of the condition is to make sure the customers keep social distance. So the stores restricted the amount of people can stay at a time in the store and outside of the store customer must stand in line keeping 1 meter distance from one to another. For the line the govt., shop owner or other organizations painting circle or box. In front of maximum shop there is no line drawing or people aren’t maintaining social distance while they are standing in the line. So it’s sometime hard for a person to maintain social distance while standing in the line though he want to.
